# Extension_ToDo
 
During the development of projects, it was often necessary to copy and peek at parts of the code from past projects, so
I saved everything on the PC, and in git everything was in one repository (AllProjectForStyding), now
I sorted everything and created a separate repository

A minimalistic task list in Chrome, with data saved in local storage. I especially played with the simple animated removal of tasks.
